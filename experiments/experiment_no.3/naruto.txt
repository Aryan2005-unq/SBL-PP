Naruto Uzumaki is a young ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village (Konohagakure) who dreams of becoming the Hokage,
the leader of his village, to gain recognition and respect from everyone. 
Born as the son of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, and Kushina Uzumaki, Naruto had a difficult childhood. 
He was orphaned at birth and grew up as an outcast because the Nine-Tails Fox (Kurama),
a powerful and destructive beast, was sealed inside him. Despite the loneliness and hardship, Naruto never gave up on his dreams.
